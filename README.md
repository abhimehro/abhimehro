I’m an undergraduate researcher in **Coastal Environmental Science + Data Science** at LSU (Expected 2027), focused on building practical tools at the intersection of **research analytics, Python engineering, and automation**.

## 🔍 Current Technical Focus

- **Data science for environmental research:** sensor-data processing, time-series correction, and reproducible analysis pipelines
- **AI + automation:** workflow automation for operational monitoring and triage
- **Security-first engineering:** threat detection and self-hosted tooling for safer systems
- **Performance + reliability:** maintainable scripts and pipelines designed for real-world use
- **User-centric design:** documentation and workflows that are accessible to collaborators across disciplines
